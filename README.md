# nixon-pixel-match
Home page clone of the Nixon website

This is a clone of only the home page for Nixon's website. No links are active.

The purpose of the site is to showcase my ability to match the layout of Nixon's home page in both desktop and mobile views. 

This project was built using bootstrap. The built in media queries and grid system helps provide a seamless transition from mobile and desktop views. Feel free to play around as you will!
